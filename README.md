https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

### Plan
- ~~Create basic server~~
- ~~Create db, connect to api~~
- ~~Create LB, use several servers~~ (Nginx proxy)
- ~~High intensity queries (better test load)~~
- ~~Use cache~~
- ~~High memory queries (test cache)~~
- Better Load balancer
- ~~Limit container resources~~
- Something that checks server load, query response times (can use docker stats for now)
- Message queue
- Kubernetes
- Create balancer for db, use multiple db
