A simple server that will be continuously upgraded

### Resource
https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

### Plan
- ~~Create basic server~~
- ~~Create db, connect to api~~
- ~~Create LB, use several servers~~ (Nginx proxy)
- High intensity queries (better test load)
- Use cache
- High memory queries (test cache) 
- Better Load balancer
- Something that checks server load, query response times (load is hard since using a single host)
- Message query
- Kubernetes
- Create balancer for db, use multiple db
